          Death by Global Warming
        </h2>
        <p id="end1Info" class="endInfo" hidden>
          Do to the recent invovement of humanity in the recent century, Earth's
          Global Warming is going out of control. Global warming has sped up by
          10% and Earth can't keep up. This causes the temperature to rise even
          faster. If global warming is not taken care of by the year 2100,
          Earth's high temperatures wil leave high water levels, little livable
          land, poisonous water, mass human deaths, agriculture problems, and
          food storages. In the end, people will just end up taking each other
          out or die to heat. This will probabily be your great, great, great,
          great grandchilderen's turn to die (if your bloodline even makes it
          that far).

        <p id="end2Info" class="endInfo" hidden>
          When the Sun begins to die and turn into a red gaint, the Sun will
          lose stability and start growing in size. While the Sun is getting
          bigger, it is also getting hotter. In about about 2 billion years (if
          we are lucky) the oceans will be boiling and all lives on Earth will
          cease to exist. In about 7.5 billion years the Sun will swallow the
          earth whole and it'll be officialy over. But you'll be dead way before
          then :)

        <p id="end3Info" class="endInfo" hidden>
          There are many asteroids in the outer space that could wipe us out if
          it struck Earth. But a particular asteroid named Bennu, is the most
          likly to collide with Earth. Using data from NASA's OSIRIS-REx
          spacecraft it was calculated that on the day of September 24, 2182
          Bennu has the highest chance to hit Earth with the odds of 1-in-2700.
